this is notes for the whole project that will make you understand the project better:

#For the package m7_livelyness_detection which is responsible for detecting smile-blink-turning head :
-here is the official documentation of it:
https://pub.dev/packages/m7_livelyness_detection
-i found a full example code you can view it in the examples folder the file m7_livelyness_detection.dart

#These some files that are well structured but never used in case you need them:
-IDCardProvider.dart : provider using riverpod for capturing a photo

#MinSdkVersion used :
-Because i'am using camera package i had to change the minSdkVersion to 21 in which i defined it in
android folder in the file local.properties.

#Always use the size_config.dart for width and height of the screens app so they can fit in other phones.

#Orginally we were going to use the the live test screens in the Test_Screens folder but because the deepfake
detection model isn't compatible with the use of mobile app we used the LiveTestScreen_V2 screen. in future development
consider using them they are ready, optimized and using riverpod as state management.

#I have private repo in gitlab that contain this project with different stages (like before implementing the logic and after)
and different commits stages. Feel free to contact me if you need it.

#If you want to add dark mode feature consider checking app_theme.dart and layouts.dart to add it there.

#Always consider using packages that consumes less size in your flutter app.

#Learn to use Dart DevTools to help you track your app always for bugs and keeping the app smoother.
